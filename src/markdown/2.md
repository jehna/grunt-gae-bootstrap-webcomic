# Git best practices: How to name your origin

This post will introduce best practice on why and how to name your git
repository's remote, by default called `origin`.

## What is `origin`?

In git, `origin` is the default name assigned to your remote branch.

Usually it gets assigned when you do a `git clone` for a remote repository.
It is also common name to use when adding a remote repository by hand:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

The name `origin` stands for "original"; stating that the default remote branch
is usually the one you used to clone the repository from.

## Why do people use the name `origin`?

Almost every tutorial or code snippet you see on the web uses `origin` as
their remote branch name. And for illustration purposes, this is just ok.

But seeing everyone use the default name can give you the impression that the
proper naming doesn't really matter.

## Using the remote service's name

The first logical name for your first remote branch is to use the name of your
remote service provider.

> For example, if using Github as the remote service, you can name your remote
  branch `github` instead of `origin`.

This approach makes your git commands more semantic. Consider that, instead of
`origin`, you'd `push` and `pull` to the service you're using, for example:
```bash
git push github master
```

Depending on your [workflow][git-workflows], it might be safe to assume that
you're using just a *single* remote repository inside your project. In that case
using the service as the remote's name makes perfect sense.

This naming remains logical even if you ever need to change your service
provider:

> Just add a remote called `bitbucket` where you push your branches and remove
  the `github` remote.

## Using the forking workflow

Popular in open source Github projects, the [fork & pull model][fork-pull-model]   
requires you to work with multiple remotes. Especially if you maintain the
project.

> But how to keep track on multiple branches from the same service?

Some people use remote names like `upstream` and `downstream` to distinct
between their own fork and the official remote. But the concept can feel hard to
understand.

An easy to understand model is to use the forker's username as the remote name.
Given that you're actually collaborating with real people, you can more easily
track who's doing what when you can associate the remote with a real human
being.

So an imaginary project could look like this:
```bash
$ git remote -v
awesome-project    https://github.com/awesome-project/awesome-project.git (fetch)
awesome-project    https://github.com/awesome-project/awesome-project.git (push)
john               https://github.com/john/awesome-project.git (fetch)
maria              https://github.com/maria/awesome-project.git (fetch)
william            https://github.com/william/awesome-project.git (fetch)
```

## Practical naming

So, when you next time start out, you can give your `origin` remote a different
name by adding an `-o` flag to your clone:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git -o github
```

And if you need to change the current `origin` remote to something more
suitable, you can easily rename it:
```bash
git remote rename origin github
```

## Roundup

Naming your remotes is a part of keeping your tools clean. As developers, we
should always be looking for best practices and questioning how the development
could be better.
