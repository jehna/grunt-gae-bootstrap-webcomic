# Git idioms

## Rename your origin

Here's a task for you: Run `git remote` in your current project. There's a 90%
chance your output will be this:

```bash
$ git remote
origin
```

You name your branches - why won't you name your remotes also?

## What is a good name for a remote repository?

The best name depends on certain factors. Let's look at some of the most usual
scenarios where you'd end up in:

### Small project

A small project is something you do yourself, or with a couple of other people.

You've been using git flow or feature branches; You all use a shared remote
repository.

Here it makes sense to have the name support the logic of the task you're doing.

For example:

```bash
$ git branch new-feture-branch
$ git push [remotename] new-feture-branch
```

Let's take a moment to look at what we're doing here:
- We're creating a new branch with `git branch`
- We're pushing that branch to our remote repository

While `git branch` does describe what we're trying to do (create a new local
branch) the pushing takes some more thought.

Normally, we'd be pushing to `git push origin ...`, but that's ideally wrong.

We don't want to push to our "starting point".

We want to push our new branch to some remote repository.

That's why the idea should be more like `git push [where] [what]`
