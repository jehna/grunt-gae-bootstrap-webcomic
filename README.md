# grunt-gae-bootstrap-webcomic

> Webcomic greatness with Bootstrap + Grunt + Google App Engine

Uses [Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/) for layout, [Grunt](gruntjs.com) to build the site dynamically and [Google App Engine](https://appengine.google.com/) to host everything. Did I mention App Engine hosting is [free](https://developers.google.com/appengine/pricing)?



## Getting Started

Install the project by running:
```shell
npm install
```

### Building
This plugin requires Grunt Command-line interface ```grunt-cli```

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may compile this project with this command:

```shell
grunt
```

Once the compilation has ended, Grunt has compiled .json, .less and image files to proper .css, html and image files inside `static/` folder

### Deploying

You can deploy this project to your own GAE site by running:
```shell
appcfg.py update static/app.yaml
```
Make sure to edit the `app.yaml` project name before deploying.

## Features

See the grunt plugin sites for more information about customization and grunt options

### Use a Bootstrap theme

You can easily use bootstrap themes from [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/) site:

1. Select a theme
2. Download `bootswatch.less` and `variables.less` files
3. Replace files at `src/less/` folder
4. Run `grunt`

### Optimized css and html

This project uses [grunt-contrib-htmlmin](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-htmlmin) to minify html, [grunt-contrib-cssmin](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-cssmin) to minify css and [grunt-uncss](https://github.com/addyosmani/grunt-uncss) to remove unnecessary css generated by Bootstrap.

### Automatic sitemap and robots.txt

This project uses [grunt-sitemap](https://github.com/RayViljoen/grunt-sitemap) to generate sitemaps and [grunt-robots-txt](https://github.com/T1st3/grunt-robots-txt) to generate robots.txt files.

### Templating

All files are compiled from a single source file, `templates/template.html` that gets it's data from `comics/*.json` files.

The compiled .html files will be compiled to `static/comics/[id]/index.html`
